# python_tasks 🐍

This repository contains my solutions to Python coding problems.
Most tasks come from [LeetCode](https://...), Codewars and some are based on real-life cases I’ve encountered.

## Structure

All tasks are stored in the main `tasks` directory.  
Inside it, you’ll find three main subfolders: `easy/`, `medium/`, and `hard/`, depending on the difficulty level.  
Each of these folders can include subfolders grouped by topic (e.g. `arrays`, `strings`, `sets`, etc.).

📝 A short description of each task is written at the beginning of the corresponding Python file.

## Purpose 🎯

I created this repository to track my progress and possibly share it with others.

This repo will be updated regularly as I solve new problems.
